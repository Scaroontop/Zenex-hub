# What Happened and What is going to happen?
My laptop kinda broke so I can't add this stuff to the src but I can update the src now using stuff I added to the Zenex hub source :D

I hope Finn or Juju can continue the SRC without me but they prob can so let them continue. 

Idk if they will continue I will try to update the src from my school laptop. 

The code might not work cause I can't even test it at all and I can't do anything too so I don't know Join the discord: Discord.gg/5W6MyymMya Finn might update it

I will add everything that I planned if I can and will no longer be updating it If you would like updates. 

I will accept pull requests so make some if you want it added also the src will be fully closed once I finish the entire thing.
